The game consists of 24 turns in which you have to choose
between 3 crops to plant, each with a different cost of 
purchase, a different revenue after harversting and a different
threshold of tolerance to weather conditions. 
If the crop stays put without growing enough it dies after 6 turns.
After dragging and dropping the crop with the mouse you should
press the enter key for the next turn to start or the 
backspace key to reset the parcels to the last state.
If you want to know more details about how to make the most
out of your crop investments wait for the text file that is about
to be open, if not, just start and have fun.
